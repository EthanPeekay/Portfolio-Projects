# Customer Churn Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer attrition. The goal is to help businesses reduce churn by leveraging data-driven insights. The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, and feature engineering, followed by predictive modeling to identify key drivers of churn.

## Objectives
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer churn data.
* Identify factors that influence customer churn.
* Visualize customer demographics and behavior.
* Provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis (CustomerChurn.csv) includes the following key attributes:

* CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
* Tenure: The number of months the customer has stayed with the company.
* MonthlyCharges: The amount charged to the customer each month.
* TotalCharges: The total amount charged to the customer over the tenure.
* Churn: A binary variable indicating whether the customer has left (Yes/No).
* Contract: The type of customer contract (Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year).
* Other features include customer demographics, services subscribed to, and payment methods.
## Tools and Libraries Used
The following tools and libraries were used for data analysis and visualization:

* Python: Main programming language for the analysis.
* Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing customer behavior and churn rates.
* Scikit-learn: For building predictive models and evaluating performance.
* Jupyter Notebook: To document the workflow and present the analysis interactively.
## Analysis Process
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
* Handle missing values, specifically in the TotalCharges column.
* Convert data types and create new features where necessary.
* Encode categorical variables for further analysis.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Investigate the distribution of customer demographics (e.g., gender, senior citizen, tenure).
* Analyze relationships between features like contract type, monthly charges, and churn rate.
* Visualize churn by customer segment using bar plots, histograms, and pie charts.
### 3. Feature Engineering
* Create new features from existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
* Perform correlation analysis to identify features with the strongest impact on churn.
### 4. Predictive Modeling (Optional)
* Build machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict customer churn.
* Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### Key Findings
* Customers with month-to-month contracts have a significantly higher churn rate.
* Higher monthly charges correlate with increased likelihood of churn.
* Long-term customers (those with higher tenure) are less likely to churn.
* Electronic payment methods are associated with higher churn rates compared to other payment types.
## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into customer churn patterns, highlighting critical factors that influence customer retention. Businesses can leverage these insights to implement targeted strategies such as offering discounts for long-term contracts or focusing on high-risk customer segments.

## Future Work
* Implement more advanced machine learning models to improve churn prediction.
* Explore customer segmentation to personalize marketing efforts.
* Perform time-series analysis on churn trends over time.
